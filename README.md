# Re-Former

> Simple project for practice working with forms in Rails.


The project consists of building out forms in your web app using different styles of forms.

  - First we set up the backend of the app, created the Users table with username, email and password columns.

  - The next few steps were just working with different types of forms
 
    - The first step was building out a form using plain HTML

    - Second step was to create the same form but using #form_tag helper 

    - And the last sytle of forms used was #forms_for  
  
  - After adding the forms for creating a new user, we added a new view for editing an existing user

  - And the last step was just to test out both of the forms

## Built With
